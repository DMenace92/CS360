•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

In this project I was tasked to create a mobile application that will give the user the ability to create a profile. One the user is registered with his/her own personal profile the user will have full access to manage and control the inventory. The application will recognize if item quantity is running low thus prompting the user with a message to order more supply. The application allows to have full control over the inventory process. Users will be able to create item update/modify the item and delete the item that is no longer available. 

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screen and features that are necessary to support the users’ needs are the login screen, register screen for new users, home screen, and modification screen. Producing a product that is simple and clean with no clutter allows the user to navigate thought the application with confidence and to increase the user’s experience and productivity.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The strategies that I implemented while developing this application were breaking the project up into two parts. Breaking up the project into two parts helped me focus on what needs to be done in the progression of the project.  Setting up the project UI first helped me form an idea that would lead to the logic aspect of the project that would be completed in the next portion of the development process.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The process of testing my application in the process of development is by running and building the code and verify that the application Is running according to how I intended it be.

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There were may challenge that I came across while in the process of development this application. The first issue was setting up the database using SQLite. I could not set up the SQLite browser correctly to have visual of the data that was created. My fix was to log the data into the command line to identify all the information that exists in the database. 

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The specific component that I found I did particularly well was the login and registration component in the project. In the past I have created login and registration forms but applying that into a android application and using java language was new to me.
